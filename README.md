# EmotionPredictionFromText
## INTRODUCTION :
Unveiling Emotions in Text : Harnessing AI for Deeper Understanding.
Emotion Prediction from Text Using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
This project builds a machine learning model to automatically classify emotions from text data.
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Text Preprocessing were the Deep Learning technique and Natural Language Processing used in this project.

## DATASET
Used Dataset [Emotion_final.csv](Emotion_final.csv)

The data comes with the Emotion and Text from the dataset.
It contains text snippets labeled with six emotions: anger, fear, happiness, love, sadness, and surprise.

## ACCURACY
21405 Unique dataset Values

Callback set to 87% => (8774464119291705)

## WHO ARE THE END USERS
- CUSTOMER SERVICE ANALYSIS : Companies in customer service fields could use the model to analyze customer reviews, emails, or chat conversations to understand customer sentiment.
- ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY: The model could be used in applications like sentiment analysis of social media feedback to gauge audience reception.
- MENTAL HEALTHING SYSTEM : Mental health professionals could incorporate the model into applications to analyze user-generated content and potentially flag indicators of distress or emotional crisis.

## TEST OUTPUT
We can use the trained model to predict emotions for new text data.

TEST 1 : Input: "I am very happy and joyful today" - Predicted Emotion: Happy 

TEST 2 : Input: "He is an arrogant and rude person" - Predicted Emotion: Anger

TEST 3 : Input: "The teacher is intimidating and scary" - Predicted Emotion: Fear

TEST 4 : Input: "Im missing your presence" - Predicted Emotion: Sadness

TEST 5 : Input: "I feel I wanna get you closer and look at your eyes and have a gentle hug" - Predicted Emotion: Love

## CONCLUSION
This project successfully built a Bidirectional LSTM model for emotion prediction in text data, achieving an accuracy of 87%

#### FUTURE WORK :

- Hyperparameter Tuning : Further optimize the model's performance by fine-tuning various parameters.
- Ensemble Learning : Combine multiple models for more robust and reliable predictions.
- Advanced Text Preprocessing : Explore techniques like incorporating sentiment lexicons for richer emotional understanding.
