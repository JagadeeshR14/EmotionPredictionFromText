# EmotionPredictionFromText
## INTRODUCTION :
Emotion Prediction from Text Using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
This project builds a machine learning model to automatically classify emotions from text data.
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Text Preprocessing were the Deep Learning technique and Natural Language Processing used in this project.

## DATASET
Used Dataset (From kaggle(Emotion_final.csv)).

The data comes with the Emotion and Text from the dataset.
It contains text snippets labeled with six emotions: anger, fear, happiness, love, sadness, and surprise.

## ACCURACY
21405 Unique dataset Values

Callback set to 87-90%

## EXAMPLE PREDICTIONS
We can use the trained model to predict emotions for new text data.

EXAMPLE 1 : Input: "I am very happy and joyful today" - Predicted Emotion: Happy 

EXAMPLE 2 : Input: "He is an arrogant and rude person" - Predicted Emotion: Anger

EXAMPLE 3 : Input: "The teacher is intimidating and scary" - Predicted Emotion: Fear

EXAMPLE 4 : Input: "Im missing your presence" - Predicted Emotion: Sadness

EXAMPLE 5 : Input: "I feel I wanna get you closer and look at your eyes and have a gentle hug" - Predicted Emotion: Love

## CONCLUSION
This project successfully built a Bidirectional LSTM model for emotion prediction in text data, achieving an accuracy of 0.8774464119291705.

### FUTURE WORK :

Hyperparameter Tuning : Further optimize the model's performance by fine-tuning various parameters.

Ensemble Learning : Combine multiple models for more robust and reliable predictions.

Advanced Text Preprocessing : Explore techniques like incorporating sentiment lexicons for richer emotional understanding.
